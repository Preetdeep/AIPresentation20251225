Steps for experiment on Ai Tools in terms of presentation

Phase 1: Document Creation
Step 1.1: Create Simple Policy Memo
Prompt for any AI:

Include: one clear policy recommendation, three supporting arguments with specific examples, one data table showing employment platform adoption rates across 5 states. Use formal government memo structure.

Step 1.2: Create Complex Business Report
Prompt for any AI:
Write a 2000-word quarterly business review for a job-matching platform operating in India. Include sections: Executive Summary, Market Analysis (competitor landscape, user growth trends), Financial Performance (revenue, costs, projections), Strategic Initiatives (3 ongoing projects), Risks and Opportunities.

Step 1.3: Create Brand Guidelines PDF
Prompt for any AI:
Create brand guidelines for a fictional company "SkillBridge India". Specify: Primary color palette (3 colors with hex codes), Secondary colors (2 colors with hex codes), Typography hierarchy (Heading font, Body font, sizes), Logo usage rules (minimum size 1 inch, clear space equal to logo height, never stretch or rotate), Slide layout preferences (title position, content margins, footer requirements).
Deliverable: Save as Word first, then export to brand_guidelines.pdf
Step 1.4: Create Reference Charts
Prompt for any AI:
Describe three charts in text format that I can later create:
1. Bar chart showing quarterly revenue growth over 8 quarters
2. Pie chart of user demographics by age group (5 segments)
3. Line graph comparing platform engagement metrics month-over-month for 12 months

Provide specific data points for each.
Action after prompt: Take the data and create actual charts in Excel or Google Sheets. Export as reference_charts.pdf
Step 1.5: Get a Logo File
Action: Either:

Create simple logo text in Canva/PowerPoint, export as logo.png
Use any existing company logo file you have
Generate one using: "Create a simple logo for SkillBridge India, clean geometric design, export as PNG with transparent background"

Deliverable: logo.png

Workaround required (if any)

Save as: Test_Results/Final_Analysis.docx

Execution Checklist
Before you start:

 All 5 source files created
 Folder structure ready
 All platform accounts accessible
 4-6 hours blocked for testing

During execution:

 Complete one full test across all platforms before moving to next test
 Document immediately (don't rely on memory)
 Screenshot errors
 Save all outputs with consistent naming

After completion:

 All scores recorded
